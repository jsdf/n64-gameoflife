## How to build (macOS or linux):

- Install [wine](https://www.winehq.org/)
- Install the n64 sdk. this repo assumes it's in the default location of `C:\ultra` (in the wine filesystem). If you've installed it somewhere else, you'll need to update this path in `compile.bat`
- Edit `./build.sh` so that WINE_PATH points to your wine binary
- Run `./build.sh`. This should build gameoflife.n64
- Run gameoflife.n64 with an emulator or an N64 flashcart
